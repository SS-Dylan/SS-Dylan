I am a graduate of East Tennessee State University who is continuing to explore his interests in the world of computers. I am currently working as an IT Analyst at [Bell Flight](https://www.bellflight.com/), where I work on a little bit of everything. I have done work from web application development, to data analysis, to end user support. I am exploring many personal projects in my free time, and plan to continue to expand my knowledge in software development. As of right now, I plan to learn more about Python and automation.
